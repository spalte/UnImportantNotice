UnImportantNotice
=================

UnimportantNotice is an OsiriX plugin that can be used by folks who use OsiriX for reasons other than medical diagnostics, including patients, researchers, veterinarians, etc. Once the plugin is installed, non-MD versions of OsiriX will no longer display the "NOT FOR MEDICAL USAGE" banner in the main viewer and will no longer bring up the popup dialog with the, "Important Notice This version of OsiriX, being a free open-source software (FOSS), is not certified as a commercial medical device for primary diagnostic imaging."
