UnImportantNotice
=================

OsiriX 6 Notice.
I wrote this plugin in the spirit of open-source software. The source code for OsiriX 6 has not been released, and therefore it canâ€™t be considered open-source. UnImportantNotice will only be updated if OsiriX 6 becomes open-source. Your options are:
- Buy OsiriX 6 from Antoine and Joris over at Pixmeo. http://www.osirix-viewer.com/Store.html
- Downgrade back to OsiriX 5.9. https://download.naturalimage.ch/OsiriX-5.9.zip


UnImportantNotice is an OsiriX plugin that can be used by folks who use OsiriX for reasons other than medical diagnostics, including patients, researchers, veterinarians, etc. Once the plugin is installed, non-MD versions of OsiriX will no longer display the "NOT FOR MEDICAL USAGE" banner in the main viewer and will no longer bring up the popup dialog with the, "Important Notice This version of OsiriX, being a free open-source software (FOSS), is not certified as a commercial medical device for primary diagnostic imaging."

A compiled version of the plugin is available at:
